# Shannon McCoy-Kornis — Technical Writer & IT Documentation Consultant

Welcome! I'm a senior technical writer specializing in:

- Developer-facing documentation (APIs, SDKs, integrations)
- Infrastructure, cloud, and security content
- Disaster recovery (DR), BCP, and compliance-aligned documentation

I write clear, actionable docs that help developers, SREs, and engineers understand complex systems quickly and use them with confidence.
