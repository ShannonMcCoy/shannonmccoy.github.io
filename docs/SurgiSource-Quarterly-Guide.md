## 3. Completing and Submitting Quarterly Case Data

The Quarterly Reporting workflow in SurgiSource guides ASC teams through validating missing fields, completing case-level data, and confirming readiness for quarterly submission.

This section outlines how to review incomplete cases, correct missing data, and verify that required information is complete before final submission.

## 3.1 Reviewing Incomplete Cases

Incomplete cases appear with visual indicators in the Reporting Dashboard. These cases require attention before your quarter can be submitted.

Common reasons for incomplete status include:

- Missing patient demographic fields  
- Missing procedure or diagnosis information  
- Missing anesthesia type  
- Missing outcomes or complication details  
- Incorrect or incomplete coding  

To review incomplete cases:

1. Filter the dashboard by **Incomplete** status.  
2. Click each case to open the **Case Details** view.  
3. Review highlighted or required fields.  
4. Enter the missing information.  
5. Save the case and return to the dashboard.

- Date of service  
- Primary procedure  
- Primary diagnosis code  
- Surgeon  
- Anesthesia type  
- Outcome (if applicable)  

Required fields may be highlighted or marked with an asterisk.

---

## 3.4 Verifying Completion Status

Once required data is entered:

1. Save the case.  
2. Return to the **Quarterly Dashboard**.  
3. Confirm the case now shows **Complete** status.  
4. Refresh the dashboard if needed using the **Refresh** button.  

The dashboard completion counts update automatically:

- *Complete Case Count* increases  
- *Incomplete Case Count* decreases  

---

## 3.5 Bulk Reviewing Cases

If your facility has high case volume, you may use bulk review workflows:

- Sort by the **Status** column to group incomplete cases  
- Apply filters to isolate specific missing fields or case types  
- Export case lists to CSV for offline review (if enabled)  

These tools help accelerate quarter-end data cleanup.

---

## 3.6 Pre-Submission Validation

Before submitting your quarterly data, perform a final review:

- Confirm **all** cases show Complete status  
- Ensure no missing indicators or flags remain  
- Validate that no duplicate cases or erroneous entries exist  
- Export a final CSV/PDF copy for facility records (optional)

Once validation is complete, your quarter is ready for submission.
